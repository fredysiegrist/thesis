First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Gina Cannarozzi to support my idea to not only transcribed the codon bias functions to a language we students are familiar with but to generate a R package that resembles a complete code. Thanks go to my Boss Zerihun Tadele for accepting a master student in his Teff group that is more interested in working on the bits that defines the teff genome than on the plants itself and more interested to run grasslands than to breed grasses. I thank the whole department to give me a nice introduction into plant science and to leave some food in the kitchen for me to survive the long coding evenings. I would like to thank all my friends who accepted my regression to go back to school and my attitude to no longer join them in drinking and eating out and all those that found other ways to entertain me. Special thanks go to my friends that offered me a bed to bring variation in my trening sessions to discover new running tracks and all sportsmen motivating me in the competitions. Almost superfluous is to thank all those contributors who worked in the past and parallely on open source codes to bring tools and innovation to the scientific community that is nowadays regarded as taken for granted but we only get the full awareness when we have to submit our work, showing our weakness and limits, for public usage.
