	abstract = "Owing to the degeneracy of the genetic code, a protein sequence can be encoded by many different synonymous mRNA coding sequences. Synonymous codon usage was once thought to be functionally neutral, but evidence now indicates it is shaped by evolutionary selection and affects other aspects of protein biogenesis beyond specifying the amino acid sequence of the protein. Synonymous rare codons, once thought to have only negative impacts on the speed and accuracy of translation, are now known to play an important role in diverse functions, including regulation of cotranslational folding, covalent modifications, secretion, and expression level. Mutations altering synonymous codon usage are linked to human diseases. However, much remains unknown about the molecular mechanisms connecting synonymous codon usage to efficient protein biogenesis and proper cell physiology. Here we review recent literature on the functional effects of codon usage, including bioinformatics approaches aimed at identifying general roles for synonymous codon usage.",

Codon adaptation has been studied across a wide range of genomes and some early analyses of plastids have shown evidence for codon adaptation in a limited set of highly expressed plastid genes. Here we study codon usage bias across all fully sequenced plastid genomes which includes representatives of the Rhodophyta, Alveolata, Cryptophyta, Euglenozoa, Glaucocystophyceae, Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and numerous lineages within the Viridiplantae, including Chlorophyta and Embryophyta. We show evidence that codon adaptation occurs in all genomes except for two, Theileria parva and Heicosporidium sp., both of which have highly reduced gene contents and no photosynthesis genes. We also show evidence that selection for codon adaptation increases the representation of the same set of codons, which we refer to as the adaptive codons, across this wide range of taxa, which is probably due to common features descended from the initial endosymbiont. We use various measures to estimate the relative strength of selection in the different lineages and show that it appears to be fairly strong in certain Stramenopiles and Chlorophyta lineages but relatively weak in many members of the Rhodophyta, Euglenozoa and Embryophyta. Given these results we propose that codon adaptation in plastids is widespread and displays the same general features as adaptation in eubacterial genomes.}, number = {5}, year = {2016}, author = {Suzuki, Haruo and Morton, Brian R}, journal = {PLoS One}, volume = {11}, address = {Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.}, pages = {e0154306}, url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196606}, title = {Codon Adaptation of Plastid Genes}, } ch International",
